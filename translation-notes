黄昏（たそがれ）る:
  To fade into twilight/dusk
  To decline/dim

  In the name, refers to a "dead" god. Gods do not die, they wane (黄昏れる).
  Actually, their soul is reborn as a mighty human with no memory of his former self. However, if the memory seal is broken, they can regain their godly power.

  To keep the analogy with dimmed light (dusk), I chose "wane" as a translation.

律動：
  魂の律動 (= The Rhythm of the Soul) was called 精神集中 (= Spiritual Concentration) in VP1. I kept Spiritual Concentration for consistency.
  Though the term 魂の律動 was used since VP1 (http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm155425 0:59).
  Its translation was kinda avoided as "あらゆる魂の律動を感じとる力" was translated as "The power to hear their souls cry out".

穢す：Defile
冥界：Niflheim (Niflheim was never explicitly mentioned, and I think this is the closest word to 冥界 in VP's context)
死靈：Deported soul
討つ：Defeat
我らがアース神族：Lit., our Æsir. Odin uses a royal plural to refer to himself and his possessions. The Japanese possessive 我らが itself is archaic. I thought that "our Æsir" sounded silly so I will ignore the possessive pronoun and just translate it as "the Æsir".
坊っちゃま！：That's how Zehpyros affectiously call Odin. I suggest "Little Master" as a translation.
死者を選定する者？:The Chooser of the Slain
戦乙女：The Battle Maiden
アース神族の再建：Restoration of the Æsir.
ゼフィロスがオーディンに怒るとき：Scold
神界：Divine world/land. Not usually literally translated, but according to current context.
黄金の兵士：Lit. Golden soldier. I have not decided what to do yet, but I will avoid to use the term "golden soldier", that does not sound VP-like.
勇敢の死：heroic death
降臨：descent
