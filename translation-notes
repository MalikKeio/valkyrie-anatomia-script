黄昏（たそがれ）る:
  To fade into twilight/dusk
  To decline/dim

  In the name, refers to a "dead" god. Gods do not die, they wane (黄昏れる).
  Actually, their soul is reborn as a mighty human with no memory of his former self. However, if the memory seal is broken, they can regain their godly power.

  To keep the analogy with dimmed light (dusk), I chose "wane" as a translation.

律動：
  魂の律動 (= The Rhythm of the Soul) was called 精神集中 (= Spiritual Concentration) in VP1. I kept Spiritual Concentration for consistency.
  Though the term 魂の律動 was used since VP1 (http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm155425 0:59).
  Its translation was kinda avoided as "あらゆる魂の律動を感じとる力" was translated as "The power to hear their souls cry out".
