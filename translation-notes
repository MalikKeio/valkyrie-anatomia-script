黄昏（たそがれ）る:
  To fade into twilight/dusk
  To decline/dim

  In the name, refers to a "dead" god. Gods do not die, they wane (黄昏れる).
  Actually, their soul is reborn as a mighty human with no memory of his former self. However, if the memory seal is broken, they can regain their godly power.

  To keep the analogy with dimmed light (dusk), I chose "wane" as a translation.
